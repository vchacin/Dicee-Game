# Dicee-Game

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for your interest in my project.

This consists of a game of dice. When we refresh the web site then the dice get thrown randomly, so that player 1 and player 2 both have their own dice values, and our web site will announce a winner depending on whose dice value was higher.

It is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Try it!
